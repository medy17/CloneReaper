# Clone Reaper

A powerful and efficient duplicate file finder with interactive options for managing disk space.

## Overview

Clone Reaper is a Python-based utility that helps you identify and manage duplicate files on your system (including safe, multi-stage deletion). It uses a multi-stage approach to efficiently scan directories, identify potential duplicates, and provide interactive options for removing unnecessary copies.

THE best duplicate finder and deleter for Windows and Linux by efficiency, speed, safety, feature richness, and ease of use.

## Features

- **Efficient scanning**: Uses file size as an initial filter to quickly identify potential duplicates
- **Accurate detection**: Performs cryptographic hash comparisons to ensure files are genuine duplicates
- **Performance optimized**:
    - Multi-core parallel processing for faster hash calculations
    - Optional partial hash pre-checking for improved performance with large files
    - Configurable hash algorithms
- **Windows hardlink detection**: Identifies hardlinked files to avoid false positives (Windows/NTFS only)
- **Interactive interface**:
    - Guided configuration setup
    - Multiple file retention strategies (keep oldest, newest, shortest path, etc.)
    - Space savings calculations
    - Confirmation prompts for safe operation
- **Detailed reporting**: Provides comprehensive information about duplicate sets

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- For Windows hardlink detection: `pywin32` package (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install optional dependencies if needed:

    `pip install pywin32    # For Windows hardlink detection`

## Usage

Simply run the script with Python and follow the interactive prompts:

`python CloneReaper.py`

The tool will guide you through:

1. Selecting a directory to scan
2. Setting minimum file size to consider
3. Choosing a hash algorithm
4. Configuring performance options
5. Reviewing results
6. Optional deletion with retention strategy selection

## Configuration Options

- **Directory**: The root folder to scan for duplicates
- **Minimum file size**: Ignore files smaller than this (bytes)
- **Hash algorithm**: Choose from any algorithm supported by your Python hashlib
- **Partial hash**: Enable faster pre-checking using only the first 64KB of files
- **Hardlink detection**: Find and report hardlinked files (Windows only)
- **Worker processes**: Number of parallel hash operations (default: half of CPU cores)

## Deletion Strategies

When removing duplicates, you can choose which file to keep:

- **First**: Keep the first file found in each set
- **Oldest**: Keep the file with the earliest modification time
- **Newest**: Keep the file with the latest modification time
- **Shortest**: Keep the file with the shortest path name
- **Longest**: Keep the file with the longest path name

## Safety Features

- Clear confirmation prompts before any file deletion
- Summary of space to be freed before confirmation
- Error handling to prevent accidental data loss

## Performance Tips

- For large file systems, enable partial hash pre-checking
- Adjust worker count based on your system capabilities
- Set a reasonable minimum file size to avoid processing tiny files
